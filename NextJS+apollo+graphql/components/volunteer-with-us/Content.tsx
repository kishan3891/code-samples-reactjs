                  <p>Reconstructors work remotely via our online platform with small groups of six students at a time, working to build relationships, encourage positive identity formation, and improve academic results.</p>
                  <p>Volunteers sign on to teach a minimum of one full course that includes 2 teaching hours per week for approximately 5 weeks.</p>
                  <Title level={3}>Our Volunteer Matching Program</Title>
                  <p>Volunteers not only give their own time for a cause we all believe in, but also provide an opportunity for children to access our classes and content who otherwise may be unable to do so.</p>
                  <Title level={3}>Teach a course, give a course</Title>
                  <p>For each course that a volunteer teaches, we will sponsor the enrollment of one child in another Reconstruction courseâ€”at no cost to the family.</p>
